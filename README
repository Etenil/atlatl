Project Goals
============
The overall goal of this branch is to make a viable core for a bigger framework, with plug-ins support and MVC structure in place and built-in support for multiple applications.

Testability needs to be stressed with the introduction of Dependency-Injection and PHPUnit support.

Finally, security features will be introduced as PHP only provides very basic safety guards and this should be part of the core of any non-trivial project.
