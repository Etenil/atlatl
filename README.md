Pull Requests
=============
Unlike the original author's branch, this branch is open to pull requests and patch proposals.

Branch Goals
============
The overall goal of this branch is to make a viable core for a bigger framework, thus constituting some sort of *nano framework*, smaller and more agile than the recently popular *micro frameworks*.

Testability will also be stressed with the introduction of Dependency-Injection and PHPUnit support.

Finally, security features will be introduced as PHP only provides very basic safety guards and this should be part of the core of any non-trivial project.
